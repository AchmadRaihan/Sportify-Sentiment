# **People Sentiment on Sportify**  

### **Dataset**  
The dataset contains sentiment towards the [Spotify] app (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexandrakim2201/spotify-dataset).  

### **Background**  
Spotify is an application that offers sound-based services, both music and podcasts. At this time, Sportify has been in great demand by various groups, whether it is in creating podcast content, music, and just listening to both types of content. With the attractive services available, Spotify is considered one of the best applications in 2022. However, based on the data obtained, the sentiment generated tends to be negative. Therefore, the following are the objectives in this project, namely:
- Analyzing the *keywords* that appear in negative sentiments to serve as recommendations in the development of the Spotify application so that users are comfortable in using it.
- Create a program to estimate the sentiment generated based on the reviews generated.

### **Objective**
The target of making this program is aimed at the Spotify company which is expected to be one of the references for analyzing the sentiment generated so that the Spotify company can improve application deficiencies based on the results of sentiment analysis.
